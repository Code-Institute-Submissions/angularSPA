This project is a web site for a window-cleaning company 'My Window Cleaner'. 
Model-View-Controller architecture is implemented using the AngularJS framework, and Bootstrap is used for the layout. It demonstrates the integration of CSS, HTML and Javascript to create a mobile-responsive website with interaction through forms.
